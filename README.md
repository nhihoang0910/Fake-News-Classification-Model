# Project Background
This project aimed to build a fake news detection model using Support Vector Machine (SVM) from Scikit-learn Libraries in Python. I used WELFake Dataset, uploaded on Kaggle, that consisted of 72,134 news articles with 35,028 real and 37,106 fake news. This dataset combined real news from 4 sites - Kaggle, McIntire, Reuters, BuzzFeed Political - to prevent overfitting.
